They are followed by 'floofers,' then 'doggos,' and then 'puppers' by quite a large margin. That may be because 'puppers' appear more often, and therefore have more opportunities to get stale. Or, they are the youngest category, and therefore have the most room to grow, especially after - for instance - having been caught being naughty."
